Installation
============

To install the AddressLib on a Unix platform execute the following commands:

1.> gunzip addlibsrc.tgz

2.> tar xvf addlibsrc.tar

3. select the desired architecture at the beginning of the "Makefile"

4. Change the target directory for the AddressLib in the Makefile.
   This is done by setting the variable "ADDRLIB" to the selected directory
   If you like to use this package in combination with the original
   header files from MoMuSys, set also the variable "MOMUSYS" to the
   correct directory and proceed with 7.
   If you like to use a simplified version of the MoMuSys data structure,
   then do the following steps:

5.> make incinstall

6.> create a link from "mymomusys.h" in the $ADDRLIB/include directory
    to "momusys.h" in the same directory
    (6.> set wdir=`pwd`; cd <$ADDLIB>/include; ln -s mymomusys.h momusys.h; cd $wdir )

7.> make

8.> make install

Usage
=====

The AddressLib is based on the data structure of the
MoMuSys MPEG-4 Verification Model.
The header files contain the descriptions of functions, and data types.

- The Vop structure is defined in the MoMuSys header files.

- The functions to access, malloc, and free data of the Vop type
  are defined in the vopio module.

- The AddressLib provides functions for inter, intra, and segment addressing
  (see also: S.Herrmann,H.Mooshofer: "A Toolbox Approach for Image
  Segmentation and Complexity Analysis", WIAMIS `97, Leuven-La-Neuve Jun. 97,
  http://www.lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de/people/second_page/helit4.ps

  and

  http://www.lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de/research/bv/segm/lis-toolbox.html)

  The functions are described in each header file: inter.h intra.h, fifo.h,
  and lifo.h.

  Common defines are also defined in address.h.

  An example program will be provided in the near future.
